# Hacking Simulator
Absolutely useless simulator that is allowing you to type whatever you want on keyboard but showing programming code instead.

# Building & Running
```shell
make sim
./sim
```
You can also run the executable with argument that will change the acceleration of typing
```shell
./sim 5
```
will type 5 characters after each keystroke

# Using the app
You can use almost all keys except `q` which quits the application

Hitting **RETURN** key will "autocomplete" the code and show some kind of results (loading bar, binary data...)
